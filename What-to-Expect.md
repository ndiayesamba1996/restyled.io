Whenever you open a Pull Request, Restyled will clone your repository, branch from that branch, and run auto-formatters on any files changed in your original Pull Request.

If differences are found, a new Pull Request is opened and brought to your attention:

If you want to adopt the restyled version, just merge that Pull Request into yours before continuing with your normal flow.
