Currently, Restyler has a single plan which allows processing public or private repositories. This plan is called *Early Adopter* and is only available in limited quantity. Once we are verified in the GitHub Marketplace, we will launch paid plans of varying sizes which will include a plan for processing private repositories.

Users who purchase the Early Adopter plan will get to keep it for as long as they want.
